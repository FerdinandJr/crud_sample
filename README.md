# PHP CRUD SAMPLE

PHP application refers to a web application built with PHP that allows users to perform the basic operations on dataâ€”creating new records, reading or viewing existing records, updating existing records, and deleting records.

PHP handles the server-side logic, while MySQL or another database manages the data storage and retrieval. This type of app is fundamental for building dynamic websites, such as blogs, user management systems, and inventory management tools.
